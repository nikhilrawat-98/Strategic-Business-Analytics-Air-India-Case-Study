## Company Background

Air India is the flag carrier of India, currently owned by the Tata Group. The airline has faced multiple financial and operational challenges over the past few decades, and this project focuses on addressing these issues through strategic business analytics.

### Key Challenges:
- **Financial Losses**: Air India reported significant losses, with a financial deficit of £11.38 billion in FY 2023, largely due to ineffective resource allocation and an unsuccessful merger.
- **Operational Inefficiencies**: The airline has a bloated workforce and an aging fleet, leading to high maintenance costs and operational delays.
- **Customer Service Issues**: Air India's poor customer service record has led to a decline in customer loyalty, despite offering competitive ticket prices.

## Strategic Solutions

### 1. Revenue Optimization Strategy

- **Predictive Pricing and Cost Optimization**: A revenue management system will be developed to dynamically adjust ticket prices based on real-time demand and seat availability. The system will utilize predictive analytics and machine learning to forecast demand and optimize ticket pricing.
- **Aircraft Purchase Analysis**: Data analytics will help Air India make informed decisions on aircraft purchases by conducting total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis, considering factors like fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and lifecycle expenses.
- **Rollout Plan**: A timeline of 9 months is proposed for the revenue management system, including data collection, infrastructure development, and a 6-month experimental period to assess the effectiveness of the system.

### 2. Operational Restructuring Strategy

- **Workforce Optimization**: By using data analytics, Air India will optimize its staffing levels based on demand forecasting, flight schedules, and seasonal variations. This will help balance permanent and contractual employees, reducing overall labor costs.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Predictive analytics will be used to minimize aircraft downtime by forecasting when components are likely to fail, allowing for proactive maintenance.
- **Supplier and Fleet Management**: Analytics will help evaluate the performance of suppliers and identify alternative suppliers to mitigate the impact of shortages, especially for aircraft engines and parts.
- **Implementation Timeline**: A phased rollout will start with a specific department, focusing on fleet optimization and workforce adjustments. The process is expected to take 10 months, with ongoing assessments.

### 3. Legacy Rebuilding and Customer Service Strategy

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Implement sentiment analysis on customer reviews and complaints to identify the root causes of dissatisfaction, enabling targeted improvements in customer service.
- **Baggage and Staff Performance**: Analytics will be applied to track baggage handling issues and staff performance, with a focus on improving service quality and reducing lost or mishandled baggage using RFID technology.
- **Flight Delay Predictions**: Predictive analytics will be used to forecast flight delays based on historical data, weather patterns, and maintenance issues. This will help improve scheduling and reduce customer inconvenience.
- **Action Plan**: The customer service overhaul will take an estimated 9 months, starting with sentiment analysis and followed by predictive tools for flight delays and staff performance assessments.

## Conclusion

By applying data analytics across key areas—revenue management, operations, and customer service—Air India can significantly improve its financial health, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. The proposed strategies align with Tata Group’s vision to restore Air India’s legacy while ensuring profitability and growth.
